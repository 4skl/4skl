I'm a french it entousiast, here are some of the hundreds of projects that I've in mind.  

Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website, GestP a stock/accounting tool, some websites,.. and learning CI/CD while building a new version of my blog [4skl.com](https://4skl.com). 

I'm heading towards cybersecurity, so I'll start soon to do a CTF a day from HackTheBox, I'll be publishing reports on my website when I'll have finished the new version (Docker, Nginx, Django, VueJS).  

You can reach me using my email or others ways, I'll be happy to answer any questions.
